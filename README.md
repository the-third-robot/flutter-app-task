# raftlabs_assignment
This is a flutter application built as an assignment for an organization. This app contains data from the internet using API's, realtime clock and internet connectivity status. Also I've used webView using url_launcher to open the linke in the application.

## Getting Started

Before cloning the repository, make sure you have the applications and SDK's listed below,
1. Flutter SDK
2. Android Studio/ VScode+Emulator 
3. JVM installed and JAVA_HOME set to environment variables.
4. Git and GitHub

## Installation and SetUp

Firstly open the CMD/Terminal in the directory you want to clone the repo, and copy the code below to clone the repository,
```
git clone https://github.com/the-third-robot/flutter-app-task.git
```
Use command ```cd flutter-app-task``` to get in the application space or open the folder using the code editors like Android Studio/ VScode

Once you open the folder, got to the terminal and use the command below to install all the dependencies and necessary packages,
```
flutter pub get
```
Now that we've set up the project we can run the project using the editors run option or by simple using the command,
```
fllutter run
```
The flutter project is running now and you can use hot-reload and hot-restart options to implement the UI in the emulator.

If you want to build the .apk file the use ```flutter build apk --debug``` for getting the .apk in debug mode and use ```flutter build apk --release``` for release mode and yuo will find the .apk files in the build folder inside the app directory.

## Now that we've set up the environment and the codebase, we are ready to start up with the developement process.

###Thank you.
